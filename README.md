# PySh-inator

A pure (as much as possible) python shell created for efficiency, customization and mostly plugins

## installation

not yet coded (soon)

## Make plugins

not yet coded (soon)

but it is meant to be very straight forward and easy to install, code, and  add to the (future) community repo

## why

Nowadays python is one of the easiest and most useful programming langage so I was kinda annoyed by the fact that so many fundamental things are still coded in bash or haskel without really having a user-friendly alternative.
